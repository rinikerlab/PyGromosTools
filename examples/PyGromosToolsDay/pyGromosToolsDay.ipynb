However, `PyGromosTools` is built up highly modular and flexible, which makes it easy to implement extensions. These extensions can be implement at very different levels within the codebase. All classes in `PyGromosTools` that represent files follow a specific structure and offer different implementations to read, write, and, modify the files."
