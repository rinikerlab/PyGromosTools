For using this repository and developing it, clone it into a directory on your machine and add the path to the repo to your python path.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/pygromos/containint/folder/pygromos

If you are using Anaconda, you might need to use to this instead:

```

Please if your writing code for this repository, first develop it on an own branch.

```bash
     git branch <MyBranch>    #generate your branch
     git checkout <MyBranch>  #switch to your branch
     git merge master   #for adding new features from master to your branch
```

If you implemented in your branch features, that you would like to share, just issue a merge/pull request with the master branch on gitlab.

If you find a bug or have an feature request, please raise an Issue.

P.s.: I can recommend Pycharm or VisualStuudioCode, for exploring the repository.
